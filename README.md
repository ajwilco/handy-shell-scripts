# handy-shell-scripts
Mostly just quick tools I wrote out of day-to-day frustrations with bash.

I primarily work in Debian or Ubuntu based systems, that may effect how useful the scripts are for you. For instance, `apts-get` is just a thing to simplify a string of `apt` commands I got sick of typing.

Deploy any one script with:
```
chmod +x [script] && sudo cp [script] /usr/local/bin/
```
